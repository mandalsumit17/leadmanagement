- Automatic backup on every feedback submission
- Data persistence across browser sessions

### Data Structure
Each feedback item contains:
```json
{
  "id": "unique_timestamp_id",
  "leadId": "lead_identifier",
  "leadName": "contact_name",
  "leadCompany": "company_name",
  "originalScore": "ai_generated_score",
  "type": "positive|negative",
  "comment": "user_comment",
  "suggestedScore": "alternative_score",
  "influencingFactors": ["factor1", "factor2"],
  "timestamp": "iso_date_string",
  "userAttribution": "user_name"
}
```

### Key Functions
