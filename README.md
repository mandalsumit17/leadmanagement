# LeadConnect AI - Lead Import Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **Backend CORS Configuration**: Added CORS support to the Flask backend to allow frontend requests
2. **Fallback Scoring**: Added robust fallback scoring when the ML API is unavailable  
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling throughout the import process
4. **Form Initialization**: Fixed import form event handler initialization
5. **Code Structure**: Cleaned up duplicate code and syntax errors

## How to Use

### Quick Start
1. Double-click `start.bat` to automatically start both frontend and backend servers
2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`
3. Click on "Import Leads" in the sidebar
4. Upload the provided `test_leads.csv` file or your own CSV file

### Manual Start
1. **Start the ML Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd ml_backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python ml_api.py
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend:**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. **Open the application:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Testing Import
1. Use the provided `test_leads.csv` file for testing
2. The CSV should have these columns:
   - Name (Contact Name)
   - Company
   - Title (Job Title)
   - Industry
   - Company Size
   - Email
   - Website
   - Page Views (number)
   - Downloads (number)
   - Webinar Attended (yes/no)

### Features
- **Automatic Scoring**: Leads are automatically scored using AI when the backend is available
- **Fallback Scoring**: When the ML API is unavailable, a rule-based scoring system is used
- **Column Mapping**: Map your CSV columns to the required fields during import
- **Real-time Feedback**: See import progress and any errors immediately

## Troubleshooting

### Import Not Working
1. Ensure both frontend (port 8000) and backend (port 5000) are running
2. Check that your CSV has all required columns
3. Verify the CSV format is correct (comma-separated, proper headers)
4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

### Backend Issues  
1. Make sure Python and pip are installed
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r ml_backend/requirements.txt`
3. Check if port 5000 is available
4. Look for error messages in the backend terminal

### CSV Format Issues
1. Ensure the first row contains column headers
2. Use proper CSV format (commas as separators)
3. Put quotes around values that contain commas
4. Use "yes"/"no" for the Webinar Attended column

## What's Working Now

✅ Import form properly initializes  
✅ CSV file upload and parsing works  
✅ Column mapping interface appears  
✅ Form submission processes leads  
✅ Fallback scoring when API unavailable  
✅ Error messages display properly  
✅ Leads appear in the dashboard after import  
✅ Hot leads are properly categorized  
✅ Analytics update after import  

The import functionality should now work properly whether the ML backend is running or not!
